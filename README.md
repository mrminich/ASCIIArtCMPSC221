Review the zyBook 1.3 section at https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/PSUBERKSCMPSC221MinichFall2018/chapter/1/section/3 .

Create an interesting piece of ASCIIArt that represents something nicely on the output screen such as block letters, emoticons, clipart, memes, business or sports logos, etc.

As always, follow the class Coding Standards.
